The average CPU utilization across all machines is approximately 52.5%. This suggests that most machines are operating at a moderate level.

The maximum CPU utilization observed was around 97.691% in machine ""ld71r18u44fws"". This indicates that this machine is under heavy load and may need more resources, such as being moved to a higher compute power with more cores.

Four machines (""ld71r16u13ws"", ""ld71r18u44fws"", ""ld71r18u44cws"", and ""ld71r18u44ews"") have spent a significant amount of time (total seconds over 80%) with high CPU utilization. The total seconds over 80% range from 0 to 96000.

The core utilization average is approximately 43.5%. This suggests that most machines are operating at a moderate level on their individual cores.

One machine (""ld71r16u13ws"") has experienced prolonged periods of high CPU utilization, with a total of 96000 seconds over 80%.",9.0,"The LLM response correctly identifies the average CPU utilization, maximum CPU utilization, and the machines with prolonged high CPU utilization. However, it does not provide the exact values for the total seconds over 80% for all machines, which is a minor discrepancy.",10.0,The LLM response accurately reflects the information provided in the 'Provided Knowledge'.

The average CPU utilization across all machines is 54.45%. The maximum CPU utilization observed was 97.69% in machine ld71r18u44fws.

Machines that spent significant time above 80% CPU utilization are:

* ld71r16u13ws (96000 seconds)
* ld71r18u44fws (600 seconds)
* ld71r18u44cws (120 seconds)

ld71r18u44bws, on the other hand, had a low CPU utilization with an average of 29.45% and no instances above 80%.

ld71r18u44ews had an average CPU utilization of 69.82%, while ld71r16u15ws and ld71r16u14ws had lower utilizations at 20.1% and 38.14%, respectively.

It's worth noting that if the central processing unit average utilization percent is above 85%, it may indicate that the machine is under heavy load and may need more resources, like being moved to a higher compute power with more cores. Conversely, if the CPU utilization is below 15%, it may be a sign of underutilization and potential cost savings by reducing resources.

The maximum CPU utilization for each machine varies, but ld71r16u13ws and ld71r18u44fws both reached above 95%.",9.0,"The response accurately summarizes the CPU usage data provided, including the average and maximum utilization percentages for each machine, as well as the total seconds over 80% utilization. However, it does not correctly state the number of occurrences when the CPU went over 80%, which is a minor discrepancy.",10.0,The response accurately reflects the information provided in the 'Provided Knowledge'.

The average CPU utilization across all machines is approximately 54.45%. The maximum CPU utilization across all machines is around 97.69% observed in machine ""ld71r16u13ws"".

Machines that spent significant time above 80% CPU utilization include:
- ""ld71r16u13ws"" with a total of 96000 seconds (approximately 27.4 hours).
- ""ld71r18u44fws"" with a total of 600 seconds.

Notable trends observed are:

* Machines like ""ld71r18u44cws"", ""ld71r18u44ews"", and ""ld71r16u13ws"" have relatively high CPU utilization, indicating potential resource bottlenecks.
* On the other hand, machines like ""ld71r18u44bws"", ""ld71r18u44dws"", and ""ld71r16u15ws"" have lower CPU utilization, suggesting they may be underutilized or experiencing less load.

It is important to note that if the central processing unit average utilisation percent is above 85%, it indicates that the machine is under heavy load and may need more resources, like being moved to a higher compute power with more cores.",9.0,"The response accurately summarizes the CPU usage data provided, including the average and maximum utilization percentages for each machine, as well as the total seconds spent above 80% utilization. However, it does not provide the exact values for the GPU utilization percentages, which were included in the original data but not explicitly mentioned in the response.",10.0,The response accurately reflects the information provided in the 'Provided Knowledge'.

The average CPU utilization across all machines is approximately 54.45%. The maximum CPU utilization observed in any machine is approximately 97.69% in machine ld71r16u13ws.

Machine ld71r18u44fws has a high CPU utilization of around 84.37%, indicating that it may be under heavy load and require more resources to optimize performance. On the other hand, machines like ld71r18u44bws and ld71r18u44dws have low CPU utilizations below 15%, suggesting that they are underutilized and could benefit from reduced resources.

The total seconds spent with CPU utilization above 80% across all machines is approximately 96000 seconds (observed in machine ld71r16u13ws), which accounts for about 26.4% of the total possible time.

Overall, the CPU usage varies significantly across different machines, with some machines experiencing high utilization rates while others remain relatively idle.",9.0,"The response accurately summarizes the average CPU utilization, maximum CPU utilization, and total seconds spent with CPU utilization above 80% for each machine.

The central processing unit (CPU) average utilization for this machine is 84.37%, which indicates that it is under heavy load and may need more resources. Additionally, the CPU maximum utilization is 97.69%, which suggests that there are opportunities for further optimization or upgrading to take advantage of the available resources.

Furthermore, considering that the single core with the highest usage has a maximum utilization of 96.48%, this machine is close to performing at maximum compute power, which may be causing a bottleneck.
